# UTSA-BC-Homework
# Code Refactor

For the following homework assignment I cleaned up the code symantically and adde a few alt atributes to the img tags.
Listed are the following changes that were done:

* On line 12 I changed the 'div' tag to a 'header' tag.

* The 'div' container from line 15-19 was replaced with a 'nav' container.

* I felt that the unordered list was not needed after replacing its original 'div' container with a 'nav' container. After cleaning up the CSS It seemded not to affect the links on the page.

* On line 22 I changed the 'div' tag with a 'section' tag.

* The 'div' parent container of lines 24-48 was replaced with a 'main' container.

* Inside the above parent container, the 'div' containers of lines 27-33, 34-40, and 41-47 were replaced with a 'section' tag.

* The 'section' container in line 27 was issued an id of search-engine-optimization.

* The alt atribute was added to each 'img' tag on lines 28, 35, 42, 55, 62, and 69.

* The parent 'div' container of lines 50-74 was replaced with the 'aside' container.

* The 'div' containers on lines 53-59, 60-66, 67-73 with 'article'

* The 'div' container of line 76-82 was replaced with a 'footer' container.

* The 'h2' tag on line 78 was replaced with a 'h2' tag.

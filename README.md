# UTSA-BC-Homework
## Code Refactor

For the following homework assignment I cleaned up the code symantically and adde a few alt atributes to the img tags.
Listed are the following changes that were done:

* On line 12 I changed the &ltdiv&gt tag to a &ltheader&gt tag.

* The 'div' container from line 15-19 was replaced with a 'nav> container.

* I felt that the unordered list was not needed after replacing its original &ltdiv&gt container with a &ltnav&gt container. After cleaning up the CSS It seemded not to affect the links on the page.

* On line 22 I changed the &ltdiv&gt tag with a &ltsection&gt tag.

* The &ltdiv&gt parent container of lines 24-48 was replaced with a &ltmain&gt container.

* Inside the above parent container, the &ltdiv&gt containers of lines 27-33, 34-40, and 41-47 were replaced with a &ltsection&gt tag.

* The &ltsection&gt container in line 27 was issued an id of search-engine-optimization.

* The alt atribute was added to each &ltimg&gt tag on lines 28, 35, 42, 55, 62, and 69.

* The parent &ltdiv&gt container of lines 50-74 was replaced with the &ltaside&gt container.

* The &ltdiv&gt containers on lines 53-59, 60-66, 67-73 with &ltarticle&gt

* The &ltdiv&gt container of line 76-82 was replaced with a &ltfooter&gt container.

* The &lth2&gt tag on line 78 was replaced with a &lth4&gt tag.
